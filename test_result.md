# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:

##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: >
  Rebuild the unified Tax Optimization Tool by extending the original IRS Escape Plan AI Playbook Generator already integrated with the app.
  This version must include all original Playbook strategy logic, and then layer on forecasting features in one continuous experience.
  Key requirements:
  - Use original playbook strategy logic 
  - Add forecasting input fields (business profit, capital available, restructure percentage)
  - Calculate tax savings estimates and lifetime forecasting (5-20 years)
  - Show scenario comparisons with charts
  - Fix RSU/stock compensation logic to only show for W-2/Blended income types
  - Final CTA for "Start My Escape Plan"

    message: "Conducted comprehensive testing of the enhanced Tax Planning Dashboard. Verified the professional 2-column layout with sticky sidebar on desktop and responsive mobile design with section navigation. The Profile Summary correctly displays user data including RSU percentage. Successfully tested the form flow and confirmed that W-2 employees are asked about stock compensation and RSU percentage, while business owners skip these questions as required. The dashboard features including Quarterly Review, Recalculate Playbook, and PDF export are all functioning properly. The implementation progress tracking works correctly with the progress bar updating when strategy statuses change. All enhancements from the review request have been successfully implemented."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the two new features: 1) Dynamic Income Input Field - Successfully verified that the field label and placeholder change based on income type: W-2 Employee shows 'What is your annual W-2 income before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 275000', Business Owner shows 'What is your annual business profit before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 500000', and Blended income shows 'What is your combined income (W-2 + business profit) before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 800000'. 2) Wealth Multiplier Loop Integration - Verified the section appears after tax savings estimate with the correct title, 4-step process, animated flywheel, and Learn More button. The Lifetime Forecast section includes the three control sections (Time Horizon, Reinvestment Strategy, Wealth Multiplier Loop) with a working checkbox that shows a purple info box when enabled. The chart shows a third purple bar for passive income when enabled. However, the Passive Income Projections section with year cards (10, 15, 20) was not found during testing."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed visual refactoring testing of the AI Playbook Generator. The UI now aligns well with the IRS Escape Plan platform design. Typography uses the correct classes: main headings have 'text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight', and body text uses 'text-base text-muted-foreground'. Color scheme has been updated to use emerald/green with primary buttons using 'bg-emerald-500 hover:bg-emerald-600'. Cards and containers now use 'rounded-2xl' with soft drop shadows ('shadow-sm'). The progress indicator is more integrated with emerald-colored active steps. The Wealth Multiplier Loop section shows the 4-step process clearly with proper styling. Strategy cards display complexity tags with appropriate colors (Beginner=emerald, Intermediate=yellow, Advanced=red). Overall, the visual refactoring successfully transforms the tool to feel like a native part of the platform rather than a third-party embed."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced Wealth Multiplier Loop section. 1) Assumptions Tooltip: Successfully verified the tooltip functionality with the 'i' icon next to the heading. When clicked, it displays all required assumptions with proper styling and rounded corners. 2) Return Rate Slider: Confirmed the slider exists in the Lifetime Forecast section with the correct range (3% to 12%) and default value of 6%. The current value is displayed beside the slider. While the slider can be moved to different values, there was an issue with the percentage display not updating in real-time during testing. 3) Enhanced Icon Design: Verified the Wealth Multiplier Loop now uses professional SVG icons instead of emoji. The icons are properly sized and use appropriate colors matching the design system (Save Tax: green, Reinvest: blue, Generate: purple, Repeat: green). 4) Real-time Updates: Successfully tested toggling the Wealth Multiplier Loop checkbox which updates the chart and shows/hides the passive income projections. Also tested with different time horizons (5, 10, 20 years). 5) Layout and Responsiveness: Confirmed the forecast controls grid layout with all 4 sections (Time Horizon, Reinvestment, Wealth Loop, Return Rate) and verified responsive behavior on mobile devices."
