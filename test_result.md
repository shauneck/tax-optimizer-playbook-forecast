# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: >
  Integrate a modular strategy card engine into the existing Escape Plan Builder. The enhancement includes:
  - Replace hardcoded strategy logic with JSON-driven approach
  - 8 strategy cards with eligibilityCriteria, quantifiedExample, howItWorks, moduleReference, glossaryTerms, and CTA logic  
  - Dynamic matching based on user inputs (income type, business profit, entity structure, etc.)
  - Visual placement in existing sections: Setup & Structure, Deduction Strategies, Exit Planning
  - Forecast integration using quantified examples from strategy cards
  - Implementation status tracking with progress indicators
  - Suppression rule support for strategies that shouldn't show under certain conditions

Click mode also functions properly, with the tooltip staying open when clicked and showing a close button. Clicking outside the tooltip or the close button correctly closes it. On mobile, the tooltip opens on tap (not hover) and displays with proper centered positioning and backdrop overlay.

All requirements have been successfully implemented: 1) Consolidated Structure: Merged header and tool card into single branded headline section with a single 'Build Your Escape Plan' headline and immediate CTA button. 2) Condensed 'How It Works' Section: Uses clean 3-column grid with smaller step circles and text sizes for compactness. 3) Repositioned Value Proposition: Converted to compact 'callout summary bar' with emerald background and white stat cards, positioned at the bottom as supporting information. 4) Visual Style Cleanup: Reduced vertical spacing, smaller font sizes, single prominent CTA button, and more compact, scannable layout. The page is responsive on different screen sizes and maintains emerald branding throughout."
