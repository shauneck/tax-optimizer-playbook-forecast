# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

The tooltip now remains stable when moving the mouse between the icon and tooltip content - no flickering was observed during testing. The container-based hover implementation works correctly, allowing users to hover over the tooltip content without it disappearing. Click mode also functions properly, with the tooltip staying open when clicked and showing a close button. Clicking outside the tooltip or the close button correctly closes it. On mobile, the tooltip opens on tap (not hover) and displays with proper centered positioning and backdrop overlay. The tooltip behavior is now stable across different interaction patterns, and the hover flicker issue has been completely resolved."

    message: "Completed testing of the two new features: 1) Dynamic Income Input Field - Successfully verified that the field label and placeholder change based on income type: W-2 Employee shows 'What is your annual W-2 income before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 275000', Business Owner shows 'What is your annual business profit before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 500000', and Blended income shows 'What is your combined income (W-2 + business profit) before taxes?' with placeholder 'e.g., 800000'. 2) Wealth Multiplier Loop Integration - Verified the section appears after tax savings estimate with the correct title, 4-step process, animated flywheel, and Learn More button. The Lifetime Forecast section includes the three control sections (Time Horizon, Reinvestment Strategy, Wealth Multiplier Loop) with a working checkbox that shows a purple info box when enabled. The chart shows a third purple bar for passive income when enabled. However, the Passive Income Projections section with year cards (10, 15, 20) was not found during testing."

    message: "Completed visual refactoring testing of the AI Playbook Generator. The UI now aligns well with the IRS Escape Plan platform design. Typography uses the correct classes: main headings have 'text-3xl font-semibold tracking-tight', and body text uses 'text-base text-muted-foreground'. Color scheme has been updated to use emerald/green with primary buttons using 'bg-emerald-500 hover:bg-emerald-600'. Cards and containers now use 'rounded-2xl' with soft drop shadows ('shadow-sm'). The progress indicator is more integrated with emerald-colored active steps. The Wealth Multiplier Loop section shows the 4-step process clearly with proper styling. Strategy cards display complexity tags with appropriate colors (Beginner=emerald, Intermediate=yellow, Advanced=red). Overall, the visual refactoring successfully transforms the tool to feel like a native part of the platform rather than a third-party embed."

    message: "Completed testing of the enhanced Wealth Multiplier Loop section. 1) Assumptions Tooltip: Successfully verified the tooltip functionality with the 'i' icon next to the heading. When clicked, it displays all required assumptions with proper styling and rounded corners. 2) Return Rate Slider: Confirmed the slider exists in the Lifetime Forecast section with the correct range (3% to 12%) and default value of 6%. The current value is displayed beside the slider. While the slider can be moved to different values, there was an issue with the percentage display not updating in real-time during testing. 3) Enhanced Icon Design: Verified the Wealth Multiplier Loop now uses professional SVG icons instead of emoji. The icons are properly sized and use appropriate colors matching the design system (Save Tax: green, Reinvest: blue, Generate: purple, Repeat: green). 4) Real-time Updates: Successfully tested toggling the Wealth Multiplier Loop checkbox which updates the chart and shows/hides the passive income projections. Also tested with different time horizons (5, 10, 20 years). 5) Layout and Responsiveness: Confirmed the forecast controls grid layout with all 4 sections (Time Horizon, Reinvestment, Wealth Loop, Return Rate) and verified responsive behavior on mobile devices."

    message: "Completed testing of the specific fixes applied to the Build Your Escape Plan tool. 1) Time Horizon Control: Successfully verified that the time horizon control has been changed from a slider to a dropdown with the required options (5, 10, 15, 20 years). The dropdown is properly styled with focus effects and appears to trigger forecast recalculation when changed. 2) Rate of Return Slider: The slider exists with the correct range (3-12%) and shows 'Compounding at: X% annually' text. However, when moving the slider to different values, the displayed percentage and compounding text do not update in real-time. The slider position moves correctly, but the displayed values remain at 6%. 3) Dynamic Forecasting: The useEffect hook for automatic recalculation appears to be implemented, but due to the issue with the return rate slider not updating its display value, it's difficult to fully verify this functionality. The time horizon dropdown changes do appear to trigger recalculation. Overall, 1 out of 3 fixes is fully working (Time Horizon Dropdown), while the Rate of Return Slider still has issues with real-time updates."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the Build Your Escape Plan tool updates. The layout hierarchy has been successfully redesigned with sections appearing in the correct order: Strategy Recommendations → Implementation Progress → Annual Tax Savings → Lifetime Forecast. The spacing in the annual savings text has been fixed, showing proper formatting with '$16,717 – $28,791 annually'. The assumptions tooltip works correctly and remains stable when hovering between the icon and content (no flicker). Conservation Easements have been completely removed from the strategy generation logic as required. The number formatting with commas works correctly as users type (e.g., 350,000). The Wealth Multiplier Loop section has professional SVG icons with appropriate colors. The time horizon control is implemented as a slider rather than a dropdown as specified in the requirements. The return rate slider exists with the correct range (3-12%) and shows 'Compounding at: X% annually' text, but there was an issue with the value not updating in real-time during testing. Overall, most requirements have been successfully implemented, with only minor issues in the forecast controls functionality."

    message: "Completed comprehensive testing of the rate of return slider in the Build Your Escape Plan tool. The issue with the slider not updating in real-time has been successfully fixed. The slider now correctly updates both the large percentage display (e.g., '6%') and the 'Compounding at: X% annually' text immediately as the slider is moved. Tested moving the slider to different values (3%, 8%, 12%) and verified that both displays update instantly. The total lifetime value calculation also updates accordingly, showing different values based on the selected rate of return. The useEffect integration is working properly, automatically recalculating forecasts when parameters change. The time horizon dropdown also works correctly, with changes triggering forecast updates. Successfully tested changing both time horizon and return rate together, and verified that all changes work together smoothly. All three fixes (simplified state updates, real-time slider updates, and useEffect integration) are now working as expected."

    message: "Completed testing of the specific fixes implemented in the Build Your Escape Plan tool. 1) Cache Invalidation: Successfully verified that the app automatically clears outdated strategy data from localStorage. The STRATEGY_LOGIC_VERSION has been updated to '2.0' to ensure any cached data containing old strategies like Conservation Easements is cleared. When starting a new analysis, all existing cached data is properly cleared. 2) QSBS Trigger Logic: Confirmed that QSBS (Qualified Small Business Stock) only appears in Exit Planning when both conditions are met: user selects 'Exit Planning' in strategy goals AND user's entity structure is 'C-Corporation'. Tested three scenarios: A) With LLC + Exit Planning: QSBS did NOT appear, only Installment Sale Strategy was shown. B) With C-corp + Exit Planning: Both QSBS and Installment Sale Strategy appeared as expected. C) With C-corp but WITHOUT Exit Planning: No Exit Planning section appeared at all.

    message: "Completed code review and analysis of the two specific changes requested for testing: 1) Manual Stock Compensation Input: Based on code review, the implementation is correct. When users select 'W-2 Employee' income type and answer 'Yes' to stock compensation, they are presented with a numeric input field at Step 7 that accepts values between 0-100 with validation. The % symbol appears as an absolute positioned span to the right of the input field. The input validation correctly restricts values to the 0-100 range. The entered percentage is properly displayed in the profile summary section in the format 'Yes (X%)'. 2) Streamlined Strategy Cards: The strategy cards have been implemented with a fixed height of 192px (h-48 class) as required. The complexity badges and module references are displayed in a flex container with gap-2 spacing, placing them on the same line. The implementation dropdown is positioned at the bottom of the card using the 'mt-auto' class. The cards have a consistent design with title, badges, description, and implementation status dropdown. Both features appear to be correctly implemented according to the code review."
